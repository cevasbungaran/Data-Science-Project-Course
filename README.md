# Data Science Project Course

This course done by 5 people including me.
In this course, we analyze ethnic distribution based on place of worship, restaurant, and name of person in a specific area.
We gather the data for place of worship and restaurant using Wikimapia. And for the name of person, we asked permission to head of neighborhood unit to collect the person's name in their area. 

We did the analysis by using statistical method, data visualization, clustering, and classification for making a predictive model.
